Build a "Snake" Game

Goal:
Build an interactive Snake clone in JavaScript. If you have never played Snake, you can read about it here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)

Musts:
1.	Use JavaScript
2.	Run on latest versions of Chrome, Safari, and FireFox
3.	Use Canvas 2D
4.	Use requestAnimationFrame
5.	Support different screen pixel ratios (densities)
6.	Use arrow keys to change direction of the Snake
7.	Increase the length of the Snake by one block for each block it "eats"
8.	Increase the speed of the Snake by a small percentage for each block it "eats"
9.	When the snake "eats" a block, randomly place a new block on the board that is a certain distance from the snake's current position and the walls.
10.	End the game if the Snake "bites its own tail" or runs into a wall

Shoulds:
1.	Use underscore
2.	Keep score
3.	Pause the game with SPACE key
4.	Reset the game by clicking on the Canvas
5.	Design the game using JavaScript objects and inheritance (use _.extend)

Coulds:
1.	Use jquery for DOM manipulation and event binding (though not really needed for this exercise)
2.	Use requirejs for dependency injection
3.	Deploy the game to Heroku using Node.js
4.	Save highscores in browser localstorage
5.	Provide different difficulty levels
6.	Provide different board sizes
7.	Support the fullscreen API
8.	Write unit tests using Mocha
9.	Surprise us with something cool
